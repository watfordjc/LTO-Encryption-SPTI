# What it is you want to do

A description of what you intend to do, or are unsure of.

## Sample Code

```csharp
List<object> list = new List<object>();

for (int i = 0; i < 12; i++)
{
  list.add(xyzzy.frotz(i));
}
```

<details>
<summary>Licence: short name for licence</summary>

If your sample code uses the same licence the repository uses, remove this spoiler section.

If your sample code uses a different licence, you can use this section to give a brief licence description and provide a link to the licence.

If your sample code incorporates some CC-BY-SA code from StackOverflow, for example, you might also want to include a link to the page.

Licensing is a software development issue. By explicitly stating the licensing terms/boilerplate licence used for the thing containing your sample code, those that help you or find your question later will know if the licence is compatible with the licence they are using.

  * Do you have a typo you can't see?
  * Are you using the wrong method/function?
  * Are you trying to do something that isn't possible yet? The question could evolve into a **Feature Request**.
